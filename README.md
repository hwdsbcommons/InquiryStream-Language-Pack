# InquiryStream-Language-Pack
The po and mo files to change the @imath's awesome IdeaStream plugin into an Inquiry Submission Space.

The Literacy and Numeracy branch of the Ministry of Education in Ontario has released a number great reference materials on the power of Inquiry-based learning environments in K-12 education

On page 6 of that first PDF, the concept of being on the lookout for potential Inquiry questions is presented: 

>"Be on the look-out for “inquiry potential” ... 
>
>Keep a record of students’ questions, especially the types of questions that occur naturally and frequently among the students you teach. These questions often offer “inquiry potential” and can be held onto and introduced when the time is right. Alternatively, the questions can be posted in the classroom (on brightly coloured paper, written by the students themselves) for the community of learners to refer to throughout their investigations.

This tweak to the language of the https://github.com/imath/wp-idea-stream plugin takes the idea presented as a "brightly coloured paper" exercise and makes it more accessible 24/7, opens the questions out to a broader audience of community members, and as Michael Fullan is prone to suggest, takes the good pedagogy and leverages technology to accellerate it.
